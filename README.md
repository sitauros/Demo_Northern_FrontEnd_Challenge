![List Session](https://i.imgur.com/kR5et3Zl.png)  
A previous coding challenge from Northern Commerce aimed towards front-end developers.  
Entailed building a mock internship form that required field validation and an HTTP request simulation.  
See the demo in action on GitHub Pages [here](https://sitauros.github.io/Demo_Northern_FrontEnd_Challenge/).

## Requirements
1. Project is to be hosted on a service with a deployment link, such as CodePen, JS Bin, etc.
2. CSS preprocessors and JS frameworks/libraries are permitted.
3. Upon submitting the form:  
   * An error message should appear next to the field if the email is invalid.
   * The browser console should log both field values if the email is valid but without refreshing the page.
   * The red button's text should change to "Submitting..." for 2 seconds to simulate an HTTP request.
   * The form should ignore any subsequent attempts to submit after the first attempt.
   * A "thank you" page should replace the form body without refreshing the page
4. Use the font styles and hex color values provided.
5. Support the last two major releases on modern browsers for both desktop and mobile.
